### Part 2 (75 pts)

 My first step would be to alert my boss in hopes that appropriate steps 
will be taken to fix the issue. I would not alert the public because that would let potential attackers know that clear vulnerabilities exist. Also, it is possible that I may face legal repercussions depending on the details of the NDA that I signed. Using this same logic, I would not inform consumer watchdogs because that still exposes the information and may subject it to potential attacker leaks even within the watchdog organization. The issues are not guaranteed to be fixed right away and minimizing the knowledge is key. 
   If my company is unwilling to postpone the release, I would not take additional action. My purpose in this entire situation was to conduct an investigation and report it to the proper parties. I am bound by a contract to fulfill this task while not exposing internal information. To take this information any further would endanger my future as well as the future of my (potential) family. 

   In terms of personal responsibility, I do not believe that I am at fault 
   that harm that may occur. I have done everything I was supposed to in terms of informing the appropriate parties in a decent time frame. The decision of the company to not delay the release means that they valued the product more than the customer and paid a price. If I informed no one, I would feel solely responsible but the fact that the information was provided and not acted on was not an error in my judgment.
