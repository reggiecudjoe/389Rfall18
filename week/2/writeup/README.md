4. After looking at robots.txt I found the secret directory. On the page source I found the flag "CMSC389R-{fly_th3_sk1es_w1th_u5}""  

5. Yes, 216.87.155.33 links to dsn1.registrar-servers.com and 216.87.152.33 links to dsn2.registrar-servers.com. Both of these were found on dnsdumpster.com

6. There was an IP address on the admin page address bar. After using mxtoolbox, I saw that it led to an Apache server.

7. Mxtoolbox showed that the server was running on Ubuntu.

8. On dnsdumpster.com there was a flag: "CMSC389R-{dns-txt-rec0rd-ftw}"
On the secret source code: CMSC389R-{fly_th3_sk1es_w1th_u5}
On the homepage source code: CMSC389R-{h1dden_fl4g_in_s0urce}

### Part 2 (55 pts)

First, to detect the port I used the nmap command. The first 1000 ports failed to have a but a search from 1001 to 2000 yielded vulnerability at port 1337.
After this, I created a brute force function using stub.py. I created a for loop that constantly connects to the server and tries mutliple passwords from the rockyou.txt file in hopes that it can access the file. If a message other than failure is printed, the code prints the current password and exits the loop. In an attempt to guess the user name I first used his email Kruegster@tutanota.com along with the password list. After failing to yield an answer after 45 minutes, I decided to try his common username; kruegster1990 along with the list of passwords. This failed as well so I attempted to use just his last name Krueger. After that failed I tried to use simply kruegster as this was still a part of the name he commonly used. After waiting roughly 15 minutes the loop was broken and the password "pokemon" was printed on the console. Using this password, I used the nc command to ssh into the server. After entering, I used the ls linux command to look at the directories. I immediately chose "home" as it was likely that user would store personal information in non-system folder. After discovering the flight records I saw that there were several files. At this point I remembered that there was a ticket listed on the instagram along with several pictures of pokemon. After inspecting the instagram I saw that AAC27670 corresponded to one of the files in the directory. Performing a cat linux command led me to the flag CMSC389R-{c0rn3rstone-air-27670}.
